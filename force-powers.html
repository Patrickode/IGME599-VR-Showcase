<p>
    Inspired by Star Warsâ€™ force powers, I made a system that allows the player to highlight an object from range, pick it up, and move it around in space by moving their hand. It simultaneously allows the player a high degree of precision to move and place objects, as well as the ability to move things quickly at larger distances.

    This implementation feels very polished to me, and I believe it would work well not only in star wars but any game featuring some telekinetic power. More generally, this implementation of mapping small scale hand movements to large scale object motion allows both precision and speed.
