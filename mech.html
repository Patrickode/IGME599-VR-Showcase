    This idea came from a simple premise: What if you could control
    a robot mech, but all the controls were very weird?
</p>
<p>
    Constraining the controls so that they move with your hands 
    when grabbed was very hard. It would be good to give the 
    pulley controls "weight" or resistance to being moved, 
    because right now they move very easily. but otherwise 
    grabbing the "physical" controls feels good. I could see
    different levels that switch up both the obstacles the
    mech has to overcome and the controls in the mech itself.
