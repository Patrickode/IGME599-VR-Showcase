    Out of all the prototypes I made, this one felt like the most fun. It’s quite easy to accidentally hit an innocent
    target with your lasers if you aren’t paying attention to where your face or hands are pointing.

    That said, I think this is my best prototype because it’s a simple one, and it would need a little something extra
    to be more than an arcade-y shooting gallery that’s fun for a few minutes. That something extra could be many
    things, though; this gimmick is very flexible. All it needs is a cool art style, interesting level design, another
    gimmick to keep track of, or something else to that effect.
