    An extension of the arm cannon prototype, I took inspiration from the 3DS game Samus Returns and it’s melee parry, implementing a sort of VR version where you can 
    knock away projectiles with the arm cannon itself. I personally think it feels pretty good, and I even implemented a feature where you can knock projectiles back at 
    the “enemies” that fired them. This feature would still need tweaking for a full game, as it’s basically otherwise near-impossible to aim the knocked-back projectile 
    without locking it to the enemy that fired it. One idea I’ve had for fixing this issue would be to send it in the direction the player is looking, or at the enemy the 
    player is focused on.
