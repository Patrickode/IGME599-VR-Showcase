    I started this project because I wanted to try and make a prototype where you shoot things out of your hands like a
    bender from Avatar: The Last Airbender or a wizard in Dungeons and Dragons. Unfortunately, getting that to feel
    right is trickier than just getting the velocity of the player’s hand and firing a bullet in that direction, which
    is what I did for this project. Aiming your shots is much, <em>much</em> harder than you’d initially think
    when the direction of the bullet is determined by your hand’s velocity. It doesn’t help that emphatic gestures can
    get tiring rather quickly. The teleportation part of the bullets doesn’t feel much different from traditional VR
    teleportation. Only being able to move in real life and through shooting targets, however, has some interesting
    implications.
