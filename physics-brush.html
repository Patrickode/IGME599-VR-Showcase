    In this project, users could create 3D shapes by "painting" with their controllers. When they were done
    painting, the object would become a physics object. The object could then be picked up by the player.

    It feels good to pick up something that you created! There is some difficulty with the player moving
    so fast that the sphere brushes separate. There is also the issue of objects attaching to your hand 
    at the point they were created, rather than where your hand is overlapping with it.
