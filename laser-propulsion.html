   The basic premise of this project was "Shield against lasers that push you around". To realize this,
   I made each hand be a shield, created lasers, and put the whole thing in zero G. When a player's 
   shield touches a laser, the laser propels the player in the direction the laser is facing. The 
   shields also double as thrusters, which are pretty necessary in a zero G environment.

    The end result was pretty satisfying. I am glad that I gave the player thrusters, it was almost as fun
    as using the lasers. The lasers were probably the most fun, except that it was a pain to get close 
    enough to the lasers in order to touch them. This is why I needed thrusters in the first place, otherwise
    there would be no other way to move. Next time I should make the lasers thicker, so they are easier to
    hit with the shields.
