    The idea behind this prototype was to prohibit the player from looking directly at something they needed to see. I
    settled on making it a heist kind of game, where you play as a thief whose vision is being recorded, so they can
    only look at the things they steal with their peripheral vision. Even in this prototype’s messy, early state, it
    already feels fun and cartoonish.

    The biggest problem here was determining when something is “stolen” or “suspicious.” My initial idea was to make it
    so looking at an object displaced from its “home”—or looking at an object’s home while it’s not there—would trigger
    an alarm. This meant I had to take note of whenever an object left its home and trigger an alarm if any of those
    objects entered the VR camera’s view frustum. I couldn’t get returning an object to avert the alarm working, nor
    could I get the alarm to trigger if the object’s home was seen without its object. If I were to try to add that as
    the prototype is now, an alarm would trigger if just a tiny bit of a displaced object’s home entered the VR camera’s
    view frustum. I could potentially fix that by giving an object two homes: one that is strict and small, with little
    leeway, and one that is bigger and more generous.
