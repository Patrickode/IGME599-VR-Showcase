    The idea of this project was to make the usual movement scheme in VR, teleportation, more diegetic. I intended for
    this to encourage the player to make more use of their real-world VR space, but that goal was out of this
    prototype’s scope; it was only there to guide my design.

    Teleporting by throwing a ball feels about the same as traditional VR teleportation, with one very obvious
    difference; you have to throw the ball, meaning you can’t aim as precisely. You can, however, throw the ball over
    and under obstructions, which has a lot of implications on potential level design. It also presents a few
    challenges: how do you handle throwing the ball into places the player can’t fit in, for example?
