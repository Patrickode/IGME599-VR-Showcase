    Have you ever felt dissatisfied with having to manage your own inventory in games that you’ve played? Luckily for you, this prototype is all about a game that manages 
    your inventory for you! All you have to do is reach into your pockets and pull out whatever comes to hand. The prototype features an infinite inventory with a handful 
    of sample items to pull from, but the full game would feature limited inventory slots that you still couldn’t control. The idea was to capture the feeling of a slapstick 
    saturday morning cartoon, and I’d say we succeeded. The only major problem was that the functionality with reaching into pockets didn’t feel as good as it could in a more 
    fleshed-out game. Being able to quickly reach into your pants and pull something out would be key to a full game, so making that interaction as smooth as possible is very 
    important. Overall, a fun concept that I definitely plan to explore further.
