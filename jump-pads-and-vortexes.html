    The main idea of this project is to give the player two fun ways to move around. 
    Players can place a physical pad on the ground that, if they collide with it, 
    will send them flying into the air. Users can also place a "vortex", essentially a 
    black hole that will pull the player toward its location.
<br />
    This was very fun! However, the vortex proved to be the more problematic of the two.
    While you can predict where you will go with the jump pads (straight up), with the 
    vortexes you could never predict your trajectory. There were some instances of placing
    a vortex on a floating platform, and instead of landing on top of the floating
    platform, I would loop around the bottom and then onto the top, always being attracted by
    the vortex. In other more common scenarios, placing a vortex in an area above me would
    send me shooting up, but far farther than I had intended. I got so high up I could see
    the whole map, which caused slight vertigo If I proceed with the vortexes, I must make
    sure they are more predictable.
