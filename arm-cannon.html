    When it came to prototyping interaction, I was very interested in testing out something like this. I decided to use Samus’ arm cannon from metroid as an inspiration, 
    basing a number of interactions off of the series’ mechanics. With the Arm-Cannon itself, it felt very natural to hold it up like Samus does while firing projectiles.

    The only big problem was that I didn’t implement anything to make the cannon feel like it had weight. It moved 1-to-1 with the controller. Another issue that could 
    arise is that a player’s arm could get tired from extended play if they were required to hold it up in the way that samus does. This could probably be countered by 
    offering options such as having what’s already implemented be “immersive mode” versus a “comfort mode” where the cannon would behave like a more traditional VR gun 
    and you wouldn’t have to hold your arm up.
