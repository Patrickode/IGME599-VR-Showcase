    This was inspired, of course, by my second-favorite bug-themed superhero, Spider-Man. I set it up so that you can lock on to predetermined grapple points, 
    and there’s a line-renderer that acts as an indicator of whether or not you’re pointing your hand at a grapple point. From there, you press in the trigger and 
    flick to launch yourself in the direction of the grapple point.

    It doesn’t function exactly like spider-man’s webs, but it’s easy to use and invokes that spider-man feeling well enough. The biggest problem with this prototype is 
    a lack of accommodations for motion-sickness. If users have a lot of trouble with VR simulation-sickness, then this isn’t a ready-to-go VR movement option.
