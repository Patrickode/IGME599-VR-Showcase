<p>
    The idea behind this prototype was to try something that would involve physically tilting your body to move, almost using yourself like a joystick. 
    I felt like a skateboard made the most sense for this kind of movement.

    Now that my time with the prototype has come and gone, i realize this would have worked better if I tracked the player’s head rotation, but 
    instead I tried using the player’s head position relative to a point in space that was set through calibration, using their head position at the time of 
    calibration. This didn’t work very well, combined with issues in finding a good “sensitivity” for the controls resulting in a nauseating experience. 
    This is definitely not a viable form of movement in VR.
