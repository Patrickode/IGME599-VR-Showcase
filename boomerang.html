<p>
    I implemented a cube that’ll return to the player’s position when thrown. It was buggy and
     needs some improvements, like a more controlled return point. The player was able to throw
      it and the cube returned to the player’s position, but it lands around the feet and isn't 
      conveniently catchable. Gravity was not a factor and it built off of the Steam VR intractable 
      script. You can see it floating at the end because the gravity was altered.
