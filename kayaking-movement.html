    The kayaking movement scheme is what you’d expect - you sit down, paddle your kayak, and move based on how you paddle. I was hoping the fixed frame of reference the kayak offers would mitigate any motion sickness that comes from accelerated rotational and translational movement that it also features, but it still seems very prone to motion sickness.

    Barring motion sickness, this is a nifty movement scheme that allows you to traverse a world without the cuts that teleporting creates, or “gamey” nonphysical movement that twinstick creates. Having the player become physically involved in moving from place to place, and allowing smooth + organic transitions between areas could facilitate more immersive experiences that give players a stronger sense of presence in their world.
