    In this prototype, specific objects, which we’ll call boards for clarity, tilt along with the player’s head,
    allowing them to roll a ball around like a real-world marble maze. It feels very intuitive, but it would need extra
    spice to truly become its own thing. For example, having the player move and platform around on the boards.

    Originally, the boards tracked the rotation of the head one-to-one, meaning that yaw was accounted for, not just
    pitch and roll. This made it so SteamVR’s built-in quick turn would send the ball flying, since the boards would
    rotate just as fast as the player.

    The way around this was to get the local upward vector of the player’s headset, take the cross product between that
    vector and the global upward vector, get the signed angle between the two vectors using the cross-product vector as
    the axis, then using the angle and axis to set the rotation of the boards.
