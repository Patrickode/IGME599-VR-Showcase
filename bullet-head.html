    In this project, players have a gun that they can use to shoot bullets. The twist is, that the
    player's POV then becomes that of the bullet! The player can then move their head to determine
    the bullet's trajectory.

    This felt good, and offered two distinct possibilities. One is a thoughtful, strategic sniper
    game where you have to carefully plan and execute shots, the other is a more frantic shooter.
    One of the differences would be bullet permanence: Will the bullet continue to exist and travel 
    if your head is not steering it? Also, I ended up having the bullet follow the player's head 
    without lag or delay. I thought if I introduced some delay it would be more "realistic", but 
    then I realized it would likely lead to frustration at best and nausea at worst.
