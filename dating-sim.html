    VR worlds are enjoyed for their chaotic messiness that stems from player interactions. 
    This is why games like Job Simulator are popular. As a result, we explored what a dating
    sim could look like in this project. The player can spill drinks, flip the table, throw 
    things at their date, and offend their date with their choice of food (if the date is a 
    vegetarian, they won't love seeing you go for meat). The date is an 
    attractive rectangle that changes color based on how attracted they are to you. If they 
    are green, then the date is going well! If they’re red then yikes, they aren’t clicking 
    with you.

    We think this game has a lot to explore and could be very entertaining and fun. 
    If this prototype in further development, it would have a text response feature, various 
    characters with different interests, and more interactions with the environment. We kept 
    the date at a simple restaurant table for this prototype. Steam VR’s assets were used for 
    standard interactions and input.
