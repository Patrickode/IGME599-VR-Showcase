    At the time, I was editing Steam VR's throwable script for the boomerang. There was a 
    sphere bouncing in the center of the map for localization/orientation purposes. A classmate 
    bumped into the sphere and learned they could interact with it like a basketball. I decided 
    to throw in a hoop and see what happens. Unfortunately, the player couldn't shoot hoops 
    because it didn't have its throwable script (it was being tampered with, we should've 
    known this before adding the hoop, but we had good spirit). My classmate said that the 
    interaction and haptics were a bit off and had trouble controlling it. More control and 
    stability would have to be programmed for players to enjoy it.
