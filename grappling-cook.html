    A VR cooking game, with a twist. Your one and only cooking implement is a multi-tool with some unorthodox functions. Unfortunately, it turns out that 
    implementing grappling hooks, and especially a VR grappling hook, is very difficult. Another problem with this prototype is that it proved to be more 
    work than we expected when it came to cooking functionality, Ingredients needed to be capable of several states by themselves, and combine with other 
    ingredients. A clear user interface that feels good to cook with would be highly necessary for a finished product.
