    This prototype allows a player to point at an object, telekinetically “grab” that object, and then send it flying by
    pulling and releasing, like a slingshot. This works intuitively and it feels good to use, but to really make it come
    together, it needs better indication. For example, controller-rumble as the player pulls on the “slingshot strings,”
    a more robust arrow indicator on the object to fling, and the right amount of weight for each flingable object.

    As a bonus, because I wanted to, I also added the ability to punch the objects in the scene and make them explode.
    This was harder than I expected, because I used layers to distinguish objects, and Unity SteamVR’s hand colliders
    are generated at runtime; thankfully, a reference to them is stored in each hand’s <code>HandPhysics.cs</code>
    script.
