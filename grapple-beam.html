    As the final part of my “Metroid VR” prototype, I implemented the grapple beam. I tried to implement the controls similarly to how they worked in Metroid Prime 3, 
    where the Wii Nunchuk is used to control the beam. Pulling things in different directions with the beam doesn’t feel all that great with the way I’ve implemented it, 
    but more fleshed-out code could easily get it to feel much better. Pulling down grapple-able panels with the beam does feel pretty cool, and combining the grapple beam 
    with the arm-cannon melee by pulling enemies closer to you could make for an interesting gameplay mechanic.
