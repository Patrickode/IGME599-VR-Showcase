    This prototype features cameras that aren't attached to the player's head where their eyes would be, but to their hands instead. You have to move your hands around to look at things,
    which is pretty disorienting. It's difficult to line your hands up so you can see "normally". The most interesting thing to me with this prototype was when I realized you could use
    this kind of camera to hide secrets that would require players to stick their hands into holes or crevices, but the other eye is left with nothing to do. I think this would work best 
    as a supplemental camera, instead of the main form of a player's vision.
