    This essentially allows the player to switch between viewing the world from their perspective and from the perspective of a “scope” mounted on a gun. This type of behavior could be used in a stealth game or cover shooter to allow the player to see or fire around corners without leaving cover.

    With a smoother transition between the views, and a solution to the “jigger” issue caused by shaky hands, this could provide an avenue to interesting gameplay. A possible solution to the “smooth transition” issue might be having a display on the gun that shows the view around the corner, or a visor the player pulls down to see from the scope’s perspective. The jitter could be dealt with by either smoothing the movement of the gun, or additionally by making it two-handed to allow finer control over its orientation.
